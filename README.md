# SharcCompiler
Tool for compiling agl::ResShaderArchive files (.sharc) to agl::ResBinaryShaderArchive files (.sharcfb).  
  
This tool is from 2019, back when I did not know much about sharc/sharcfb files. Therefore, most of what's here is just guess work. However, I confirmed it to work properly with shaders from New Super Mario Bros. U.
